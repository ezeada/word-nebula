    <p>I make contemporary art with contemporary materials,</p>
    <p>and formats and media easily available and widely used today.</p>
    <p>I use industrially produced consumer products,</p>
    <p>digital technologies and online platforms</p>
    <p>in the same way others use photography, video,</p>
    <p>oil paint or clay. The themes that run through my work</p>
    <p>deal with the origin and cultural impact of these new materials.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <p>I think this is the best way to avoid a categorization</p>
    <p>that would put my work in a niche that is perhaps too narrow.</p>
    <p>Digital art is a specific stream of art production</p>
    <p>that historically has accumulated a certain identity and agency.</p>
    <p>Although I was originally inspired by it,</p>
    <p>I prefer my work to be seen as just contemporary.</p>

    <p>Crumb: Everything's interconnected, right?</p>
    <p>Every time you breathe you affect the universe.</p>
    <p>Groth: That's right.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>We are all part of some giant entity,</p>
    <p>some kind of organism, whatever you want to call it,</p>
    <p>and it's huge and vast, and beyond our comprehension</p>
    <p>because we can't know what's going on everywhere all the time.</p>
    <p>We can't. We can't even know what's going on</p>
    <p>in the house next door let alone out there</p>
    <p>in the billions of stars and planets.</p>
    <p>So it's bigger than we can possibly, in our little limited human existence, understand fully.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, something in us wants to know,</p>
    <p>something has a desire for knowledge. That's where "gnosis" actually comes from, "knowledge."</p>
    <p>So it's seeking after that knowledge that's interesting.</p>
    <p>We all have some interest in that, but we get stuck in dogmatic, doctrinal thinking,</p>
    <p>which makes us feel secure. It's like building a wall around yourself,</p>
    <p>against the unknown, you know?</p>
